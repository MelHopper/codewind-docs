### Adding registries in Che
After Che is started and running, add the container registry that will be used with Codewind.
- On OpenShift or other Kube platforms, you can push your images to any Docker registry, such as Docker Hub, Quay.io, Google Cloud Registry (GCR), and more.
- On IBM Cloud Private, you can push your image to any Docker registry *except* the internal Docker registry.

You'll need the following information to complete the instructions to add the registries:
  - Server: `<registry-to-push-images-to>`
  - Username: `<Your username>`
  - Password: `<Your password>`

For information about adding deployment registries to Che, consult our [registry documentation](image-registry-credentials.html).

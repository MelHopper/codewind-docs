# Making a code change
<br/>
Codewind will automatically build and redeploy your application whenever you make a code change and save the file.

To see this in action, we can make a change to the getting started example.

First step is to edit the index.html file

![](dist/images/eclipsechangeproject1.png){:width="800px"}

and navigate to the bottom of the file to find the lines

![](dist/images/eclipsechangeproject2.png)

Change the heading from *Congratulations* to be *I did this* and save the file

Clicking the
![](dist/images/eclipseopenprojecticon.png)
icon will now show your code change running

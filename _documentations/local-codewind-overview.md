# Overview: Using Codewind locally

Codewind can be used in one of three ways - locally, [hosted](./eclipseche-codewind-overview.html) as an application on a cloud, or [remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html). 

By using Codewind locally, you can develop, build and run your code all on your local machine using your local IDE.

To use Codewind [remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html), you must first follow this tutorial to set up Codewind on your local machine and then proceed to either:

1. Deploy Codewind to your cloud (if not already done so by you or a sysadmin/DevOps engineer) by following the tutorial [Deploying Codewind Remotely](./remote-deploying-codewind.html)).
2. Follow the tutorial [Using Codewind Remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html) to connect your Codewind extension of your local desktop IDE to Codewind in your cloud

# What you will learn

You will learn how to:

1. Install Codewind into your IDE on your local machine
2. Create your first Codewind project using Codewind's standardised, containerised project templates
3. Use Codewind's auto-build-and run feature by making a code change in your project

### Next Steps

Select your IDE to proceed with the installation of Codewind to your local machine:
1. [VS Code](./vsc-getting-started.html)
2. [Eclipse](./eclipse-getting-started.html)
3. [IntelliJ](./intellij-getting-started.html)

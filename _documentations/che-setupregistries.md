# Adding an image registry in Codewind in Che

## Prerequisite: Determining if you need an image registry for building your Docker-based projects in the cloud

 Codewind uses image registries for the following purposes:

 1. working with templates that are hosted on non-public image registries.
 2. building projects in the cloud.
 
When building Dockerfile-based projects in the cloud, Codewind on Eclipse Che pushes an image of your built project to a container image registry.

You must [add the image registry](#adding-an-image-registry-in-codewind) to Codewind if your container image registry requires credentials.

**If you are developing a Codewind or Appsody style project** the image deployment registry that Codewind can use is based on the style of project you are developing on your cloud: 

- **Codewind style project** Codewind needs an image registry and an account on that image registry. 

Codewind uses [`buildah`](https://github.com/containers/buildah) to build container images from Dockerfiles and to push the images to an image registry that you specify. Use any registry as long as `buildah` and the node that Codewind is running on can resolve the registry hostname. If `buildah` cannot resolve the registry hostname, `buildah` cannot push your projects to the registry, and deployment on Kubernetes is prevented.

- **Appsody style project** The image registry for the Appsody stacks ADD LINK TO REGISTRY requires credentials. 

**If you are using Codewind with OKD or Openshift** You can use the OpenShift internal container registry with Codewind. For instructions, see [Adding the OpenShift internal registry with Codewind](openshiftregistry.html).

## Adding an image registry in Codewind

1. Start Codewind for Eclipse Che and ensure the project is running
2. From the Codewind Project Explorer view, right-click **Projects** and select **Image Registry Manager**.
3. From the **Image Registry Manager**, click **Add New**.
4. Enter the following information to add the registry:
  - Registry server name or domain name: `<registry-to-push-images-to>`
  - User name: `<Your username>`
  - Password or API key: `<Your password or API key>`
5. If you're using the newly added registry as a push registry, enter the namespace that you want to push your images to.
  - For recommended values for common registries, see the [examples](#examples).
6. Click **Select a Push Registry** to determine which registry you use to push Codewind style projects to.


## Examples:
These examples show recommended values for common registries and have been tested and verified for use with Codewind:

- Docker Hub:
    - Address: `docker.io`
    - Namespace: `<namespace>`
    - Credentials: Docker Hub user name and password or access token
    - **Note:** For Docker Hub, the `Namespace` value is likely to be your user name. 
- Quay.io:
    - Address: `https://quay.io`
    - Namespace: `<namespace>`
    - Credentials: Quay.io user name and encrypted password
- Artifactory
    - Address: `<artifactory-hostname>`
    - Namespace: `<namespace>`
    - Credentials: Artifactory user name and access token
- OpenShift Registry
    - Address: `docker-registry.default.svc:5000`
    - Namespace: `<project>`
    - Credentials: OpenShift user name and access token

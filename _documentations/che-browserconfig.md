# Configuring Codewind on Eclipse Che with your browser and cluster

Ensure you have completed both the [prerequisites](./che-installinfo.html#prerequisites) and [installed Codewind on Eclipse Che](./che-installinfo.html#choose-from-the-following-instructions).

If you did not install Eclipse Che with **publicly signed certificates**, you must now follow instructions to [add certificates for Che to your browser](./che-browserconfig.html#adding-certificates-for-che-to-your-browser).

**If you are running on Openshift** you must also perform [additional steps](./che-browserconfig.html#additional-instructions-for-openshift) to:
- Enable Codewind to be run as privileged and as root
- Download the Openshift router's Certificate Authority certificates. 

### Adding certificates for Che to your browser

If you configured Eclipse Che with **self-signed certificates**, you need to add the `ca.crt` for Eclipse Che to your browser. Examples of configuring Che with self-signed certificates include the following examples:
  - Completing the [Codewind for Eclipse Che prerequisites and installation steps](./che-installinfo) for Kubernetes
  - Installing Che on an OpenShift cluster with self-signed-certificate

**note:** The following steps for adding certificates are not necessary if you installed Che with publicly signed certificates, such as on OpenShift on IBM Cloud.

#### Adding the ca.crt to Google Chrome

On macOS, follow these steps:

1. Open **Keychain Access** and click **File**>**Import items**.
2. Locate the `rootCa.crt` that you downloaded and import it.
3. Find and click the certificate in Keychain.
4. In the window that opens, expand the **Trust section**. Under **When using this certificate**, select **Always trust**. Click **save**.
5. Reload Eclipse Che in your browser.

On Windows, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Chrome preferences, select **Privacy and Security**, and click **Manage Certificates**.
2. In the window that appears, click the **Trusted Root Certificate Authorities** tab.
3. Locate the `rootCa.crt` that you downloaded and import it.
4. Restart Google Chrome and access the Eclipse Che URL.

#### Adding the ca.crt to Firefox

1. Go to **Preferences**>**Privacy and Security**>**View certificates**.
2. Click **Authorities** and click **Import**.
3. Locate the `rootCa.crt` that you downloaded and import it.
4. Reload Eclipse Che in your browser.

### Additional instructions for Openshift

**Running on OpenShift with self-signed certificates** If you are running with self-signed certificates, follow these instructions to download the router's ca.crt:

1. Authenticate against your OpenShift cluster, or ask your cluster administrator to do so.
2. Run the following command to download the router's `ca.crt`:
```
$ oc get secret router-ca -n openshift-ingress-operator -o jsonpath="{.data.tls\.crt}" | base64 -d > rootCa.crt
```

**Enabling Codewind to run as privileged and as root** Codewind needs to run as privileged and as root because it builds container images. If your cluster is running OpenShift, run the following commands, where `<che namespace>` is the namespace into which you installed Che.
1. To enable privileged containers, enter `oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:<che namespace>:che-workspace`.
2. To enable containers to run as root, enter `oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:<che namespace>:che-workspace`.

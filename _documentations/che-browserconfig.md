# Configuring Codewind on Eclipse Che with your browser and cluster

Ensure you have completed the [prerequisites to installing Codewind on Eclipse Che](./che-installinfo.html#prerequisites).

If you:
- installed Eclipse Che with **self-signed certificates**

or

- if self-signed certificates are being used for communication between your browser and your cluster

or

- you are using an **Openshift** cluster

follow instructions to [add certificates for Che to your browser](./che-browserconfig.html#adding-certificates-for-che-to-your-browser). **Caution: do not use self-signed certificates in production**

**Note:** If you completed the [Codewind for Eclipse Che prerequisites and installation steps](./che-installinfo.html) for Kubernetes then you have installed Eclipse Che with self-signed certificates.

**You may skip this step** to [add certificates for Che to your browser](./che-browserconfig.html#adding-certificates-for-che-to-your-browser) and instead proceed to [adding an image registry in Codewind on Che](./che-setupregistries.html) if:

- you installed Eclipse Che with certificates signed by a certificate authority. For more information about how to install Eclipse Che with a certificate signed by a certificate authority, see [ADD LINK](./). 
- your cluster uses publicly-signed certificates, for example, Openshit on IBM Cloud
- you are not using certificates **Caution: this is not advised**

For more information about how to test whether your Eclipse Che installation is secure you can use [ADD LINK](hhtp://myserver.com)

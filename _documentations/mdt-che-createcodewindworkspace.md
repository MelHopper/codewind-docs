### Creating the Codewind workspace with a Devfile
The general format for creating a Che workspace via a factory is:
```
http://<che ingress domain>/f?url=<hosted devfile URL>
```

Codewind includes a ready-to-use devfile with its plug-ins. Enter the following URL to create a workspace from the devfile:
```
http://<che ingress domain>/f?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin/0.7.0/devfiles/0.7.0/devfile.yaml
```

For other sample devfiles, see https://github.com/kabanero-io/codewind-templates/tree/master/devfiles.

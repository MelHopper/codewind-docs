# Extensions

The following extensions are available for Codewind, Eclipse, and VS Code to further enhance your development experience.

## Appsody

Appsody simplifies the development experience and enables you to focus on your application code. Appsody provides pre-configured application stacks which use the Dockerfile syntax to specify which language runtimes, frameworks, libraries, and tools are included. Project templates build upon these stacks, and provide you with a template application that you can bring into your IDE of choice and begin development.

For more information, see [Installing Appsody](https://appsody.dev/docs/getting-started/installation).

## Codewind OpenAPI Tools for Eclipse

The Codewind OpenAPI Tools for Eclipse includes wizards that invoke the OpenAPI Generator to create API clients, server stubs, and HTML documentation from OpenAPI Specifications. The tools are integrated and customized to work with Codewind for Eclipse, but they also work with a base Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers installation.

For more information, see [Codewind OpenAPI Tools for Eclipse](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind-openapi-eclipse).

## Codewind OpenAPI Tools for VS Code

The Codewind OpenAPI Tools for VS Code provides commands that invoke the OpenAPI Generator to create API clients, server stubs, and HTML documentation from OpenAPI Specifications. The tools are integrated and customized to work with Codewind for VS Code, but they can also work without the Codewind extension.

For more information, see [Codewind OpenAPI Tools for VS Code](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind-openapi-vscode).
